## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-30

### üéâ Major Features Added
- **Auto-generated conversation titles**: Conversations now automatically use the first user message as the title instead of generic "New Conversation"
- **Enhanced GPT-5-mini support**: Improved parsing for complex response format with web search integration
- **Comprehensive sources extraction**: URLs in AI responses automatically enriched with favicons, titles, and thumbnails
- **Table rendering**: Frontend automatically parses and renders pipe-separated tables from AI responses

### üêõ Critical Bugs Fixed
- **Sources loading in chat history**: Fixed metadata preservation issue where conversation history was stripping message sources
- **Conversation loading 500 errors**: Resolved missing `uuid` import in `chat.py:162` that was causing server crashes
- **Pydantic validation errors**: Removed conflicting `response_model=ConversationResponse` constraint in conversation endpoint
- **GPT-5-mini incomplete responses**: Enhanced parsing to handle truncated responses and token limit issues

### üöÄ Performance Improvements  
- **Token optimization**: GPT-5-mini now gets 4000 tokens (vs 1500 for other models) to accommodate web search operations
- **Incomplete response handling**: Graceful degradation when AI responses are truncated with helpful user messages
- **Database fallback patterns**: Resilient operation continues even when database connections fail
- **Async source enrichment**: Concurrent metadata fetching with semaphore limiting and timeout protection

### üß™ Testing Enhancements
- **Integration test suite**: Added comprehensive tests that verify actual functionality vs just endpoint accessibility  
- **Test coverage expansion**: New tests catch real business logic issues that ping tests missed
- **Response format validation**: Tests ensure frontend-backend compatibility for message metadata
- **End-to-end verification**: Complete chat flow testing from message send to conversation loading

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer Experience
- **Enhanced error logging**: Detailed debugging output for AI response parsing and sources extraction
- **Improved documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation, architecture guides, and code comments

## Bug Fix Details

### Sources Loading Issue (Fixed in 1.2.0)
**Problem**: When users clicked on chat history to load previous conversations, the sources (website links with favicons) were not appearing even though the AI had originally provided them.

**Root Cause**: The conversation history endpoint in `chat.py:155-171` was creating a new response format that stripped the `metadata` field from messages during serialization.

**Solution**: Modified the endpoint to preserve the complete message structure including metadata:
```python
# Before (metadata stripped)
return ConversationResponse(...)

# After (metadata preserved)  
return {
    "messages": [
        {
            "metadata": msg.get("metadata", {})  # Preserves sources
        }
    ]
}
```

**Impact**: All historical conversations now show sources correctly when loaded.

### UUID Import Error (Fixed in 1.2.0)
**Problem**: Loading conversation history resulted in 500 errors with "name 'uuid' is not defined".

**Root Cause**: Line 162 in `chat.py` was using `uuid.uuid4()` but the `uuid` module wasn't imported.

**Solution**: Added `import uuid` to the imports section.

**Impact**: Conversation loading now works reliably without server errors.

### Pydantic Validation Error (Fixed in 1.2.0)
**Problem**: Conversation endpoint returned ResponseValidationError complaining about missing required fields.

**Root Cause**: The endpoint decorator specified `response_model=ConversationResponse` but the actual response was a plain dictionary that didn't match the Pydantic model structure.

**Solution**: Removed the `response_model` constraint to allow flexible response format that matches frontend expectations.

**Impact**: Conversation loading works without validation conflicts.

### GPT-5-mini Response Parsing (Fixed in 1.2.0)
**Problem**: GPT-5-mini would return "I received your message but couldn't generate a proper response" instead of actual responses.

**Root Cause**: GPT-5-mini uses a complex response format with reasoning steps and web searches that wasn't being parsed correctly. It was also hitting the 1500 token limit during web search operations.

**Solution**: 
1. Increased token limit to 4000 for GPT-5-mini
2. Added specialized parsing for incomplete responses
3. Enhanced error handling for truncated responses

**Impact**: GPT-5-mini now works correctly with web search and reasoning capabilities.

## Testing Improvements

### Before (Ping Tests Only)
- Tests only verified endpoint accessibility (200/404/422 status codes)
- No validation of actual business logic
- Passed even when core functionality was broken
- Example: Sources extraction bug went undetected

### After (Comprehensive Testing)
- **Ping tests**: Endpoint accessibility and basic validation
- **Integration tests**: Actual functionality verification
- **Business logic testing**: Sources extraction, metadata preservation, conversation flow
- **Response format validation**: Ensures frontend-backend compatibility

### Test Coverage Statistics
- **Total tests**: 185+ across all modules
- **Ping tests**: 18/18 passing (endpoint accessibility)
- **Integration tests**: 4/4 passing (business logic)  
- **Coverage areas**: Authentication, chat functionality, database operations, error handling

## Architecture Evolution

### Service Layer Pattern
- **Before**: Business logic mixed with API endpoints
- **After**: Clean separation with dedicated service layer
- **Benefits**: Better testability, reusability, and maintainability

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Before**: Basic try/catch with generic errors
- **After**: Layered error handling with fallback patterns
- **Benefits**: Graceful degradation and better user experience

### Database Integration
- **Before**: Direct database calls from endpoints
- **After**: Service layer with fallback to in-memory storage
- **Benefits**: Development flexibility and production resilience
