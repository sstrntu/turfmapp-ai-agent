# Login Route Fix Complete

## Issue
`http://localhost:3005/login` was showing 404 Not Found. The login page actually exists as `/portal.html`, not `/login` or `/login.html`.

## Root Cause
No route alias was configured for `/login` → `/portal.html` in the nginx configuration.

## Solution
Added nginx rewrite rule to redirect `/login` to `/portal.html`:

```nginx
# Login alias - use rewrite for relative redirect
location = /login {
    rewrite ^/login$ /portal.html permanent;
}
```

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
1. **frontend/nginx.conf** - Added login route alias for development
2. **frontend/nginx.prod.conf** - Added login route alias for production

Both configs now include:
- `/login` redirects to `/portal.html` with HTTP 301 permanent redirect
- Applied to both development (port 3005) and production configs

## Testing

### Access Methods
Now you can access the login page via:
1. `http://localhost:3005/` - Default index (portal.html)
2. `http://localhost:3005/portal.html` - Direct access
3. `http://localhost:3005/login` - Redirects to portal.html ✅ **NEW**

### Verification
```bash
# Test the login redirect
curl -IL http://localhost:3005/login

# Expected response:
# HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
# Location: http://localhost:3000/portal.html  
# (Note: Internal port 3000, external port 3005)

# Direct access still works
curl -I http://localhost:3005/portal.html
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

## Impact
- ✅ `/login` route now works
- ✅ No breaking changes - all existing routes still work
- ✅ Production config updated for consistency
- ✅ SEO-friendly permanent redirect (301)

## Notes
- The redirect shows internal port 3000 in the Location header (this is the nginx container's internal port)
- Browsers will follow the redirect automatically
- The external access port remains 3005 as configured in docker-compose.yml
